- **Firebase Storage security rules** (no changes needed)
- **Audio player infrastructure** (unchanged, works with unified service)
- **Waveform generation system** (unchanged, uses cached files)
- **Audio recording infrastructure** (unchanged, uses unified upload)
- **Existing migration scripts** (still functional)

All existing functionality was preserved while improving the underlying architecture.

## ✅ Implementation Completed

The consolidation followed a **phased approach** that was successfully executed:

1. **✅ Phase 1**: Fixed critical blockers (imports, DI config) - **COMPLETED**
2. **✅ Phase 2**: Created domain contracts (`AudioFileRepository`, `DirectoryService`) - **COMPLETED**
3. **✅ Phase 3**: Built unified audio service with caching and progress tracking - **COMPLETED**
4. **✅ Phase 4**: Migrated all consumers to unified service - **COMPLETED**
5. **✅ Phase 5**: Removed deprecated code and validated - **COMPLETED**

Each phase included **automated and manual verification** ensuring the system remained functional throughout the migration.
