# Audio Player Legacy Cleanup Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for cleaning up the legacy audio_player implementation after successful migration to the pure audio architecture.

## Files to Remove (After Migration Complete)

### 🔄 Migration Strategy

#### Phase A: Validation (Week 1)
- [ ] Verify all screens using new pure audio architecture
- [ ] Confirm no references to legacy audio_player BLoC
- [ ] Test backward compatibility adapter functionality
- [ ] Performance comparison: old vs new architecture

#### Phase B: Incremental Removal (Week 2)
- [ ] Remove legacy BLoC files
- [ ] Remove old UI widgets
- [ ] Remove coupled use cases
- [ ] Remove coupled entities

#### Phase C: Cleanup (Week 3)
- [ ] Update imports across codebase
- [ ] Remove legacy adapter (after full migration)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Final testing and validation

## Files to Keep

### ✅ Shared Services (Used by Both Architectures)
- `OfflineModeService` - Network and connectivity management
- `PlaybackStatePersistence` - State persistence utilities
- `AudioSourceResolverImpl` - Cache resolution logic (legacy version)

### ✅ Infrastructure Components
- Cache orchestration services
- Network info services
- Connectivity services

## Migration Verification Checklist

### 🔍 Pre-Cleanup Validation
- [ ] All screens migrated to pure audio architecture
- [ ] No runtime errors in production
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Rollback plan tested and ready

### 🧪 Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for pure audio architecture
- [ ] Integration tests with cache system
- [ ] End-to-end user journey tests
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Offline mode functionality tests

### 📊 Monitoring and Metrics
- [ ] Audio playback success rate
- [ ] Cache hit rate and efficiency
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] CPU usage during playback
- [ ] User engagement metrics

## Risk Mitigation

### 🚨 Rollback Plan
1. **Feature Flag**: Keep `AudioArchitectureFeatureFlags.enableLegacyFallback = true`
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Use percentage-based user segmentation
3. **Quick Revert**: Ability to switch back to legacy within hours
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensure no data loss during migration

### 🛡️ Safety Measures
- Maintain legacy adapter for 2 weeks post-migration
- Keep legacy BLoC registered in DI for emergency fallback
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- User feedback collection mechanism

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Technical Goals
- [ ] 100% feature parity with legacy implementation
- [ ] Performance improvement (faster load times)
- [ ] Memory usage reduction
- [ ] Code maintainability improvement
- [ ] Test coverage ≥ 90%

### ✅ Business Goals
- [ ] No user-reported regressions
- [ ] Improved offline experience
- [ ] Better cache management
- [ ] Enhanced developer productivity
- [ ] Foundation for future audio features

## Timeline

| Week | Phase | Activities |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Validation | Complete testing, performance validation |
| 2 | Migration | Remove legacy components incrementally |
| 3 | Cleanup | Final cleanup, documentation update |
| 4 | Monitoring | Monitor production, collect feedback |

## Dependencies

### 🔗 External Dependencies
- Cache orchestration service availability
- Network connectivity service stability
- Audio playback library compatibility
- Device-specific audio driver support

### 🏗️ Internal Dependencies
- User profile service integration
- Project management system compatibility
- Collaboration features integration
- Analytics and monitoring systems

---

**Note**: This cleanup should only be executed after the pure audio architecture has been proven stable and successful in production for at least 1-2 weeks.
