### ✅ Phase 2: Data Sources Refactor (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Segregate interfaces, eliminate duplicates, standardize return types.

**Accomplishments:**

- [x] **Fixed AuthLocalDataSource SRP violation** - Split into UserSessionLocalDataSource and OnboardingStateLocalDataSource
- [x] **Standardized return types** - All data sources now return Either<Failure, T>

- Updated all data sources with proper Either<Failure, T> patterns

### ✅ Phase 3: Repository Refactor (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Separate responsibilities, implement proper abstraction layers.

**Major SRP Violations Fixed:**

#### 1. ✅ AuthRepository Split (3 repositories)

- **AuthRepository** - Authentication operations only (`signIn`, `signOut`, `authState`)
- **OnboardingRepository** - Onboarding state management
- **WelcomeScreenRepository** - Welcome screen state management

#### 2. ✅ ManageCollaboratorsRepository Split

- **CollaboratorRepository** - Collaborator management only
- Moved `updateProject()` to ProjectsRepository (eliminated duplication)

#### 3. ✅ UserProfileRepository Split (2 repositories)

- **UserProfileRepository** - Individual profile operations (`updateUserProfile`, `getUserProfile`, `watchUserProfile`)
- **UserProfileCacheRepository** - Bulk cache operations (`cacheUserProfiles`, `getUserProfilesByIds`, `watchUserProfilesByIds`, `preloadProfiles`)

#### 4. ✅ CacheStorageRepository Split (4 repositories + facade)

- **AudioDownloadRepository** - Download operations, progress tracking, cancellation
- **AudioStorageRepository** - Physical file storage, retrieval, storage monitoring
- **CacheKeyRepository** - Cache key generation, validation, conversion
- **CacheMaintenanceRepository** - Validation, cleanup, migration, health monitoring
- **CacheStorageFacadeRepository** - Backward compatibility facade

**Files Created:**

├── auth_repository.dart
├── onboarding_repository.dart
└── welcome_screen_repository.dart

lib/features/user_profile/domain/repositories/

```

**Backward Compatibility:**

- Original repositories marked as `@Deprecated` with clear migration guidance
- Facade patterns implemented for gradual migration
- Existing use cases updated to use new specialized repositories

---

## 🎯 SOLID Principles Applied

### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- **Before:** Repositories handling 2-4+ responsibilities
- **After:** Each repository has exactly 1 responsibility
- **Impact:** Improved maintainability, testability, and code clarity

### ✅ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- **Before:** Large interfaces with methods not used by all clients
- **After:** Small, focused interfaces for specific use cases
- **Impact:** Clients only depend on methods they actually use

### ✅ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- **Before:** Concrete dependencies in repository layers
- **After:** Abstract interfaces with injectable implementations
- **Impact:** Loose coupling, better testability, implementation flexibility

### ✅ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- **Before:** Repositories requiring modification for new features
- **After:** Extensible through composition and inheritance
- **Impact:** New features can be added without modifying existing code

### ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- **Before:** Inconsistent entity inheritance patterns
- **After:** Proper Entity<T> and AggregateRoot<T> inheritance
- **Impact:** Consistent behavior across entity hierarchies
