## 📱 Current Platform Status

### iOS Icons: ✅ CONFIGURED

You have flavor-specific icon sets already generated:
- ✅ `AppIcon-Dev.appiconset` (15 icons)
- ✅ `AppIcon-Staging.appiconset` (15 icons)
- ✅ `AppIcon-Prod.appiconset` (15 icons)

**Location:** `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/`

### Android Icons: ⚠️ USING GENERIC ICONS

Currently all Android flavors share the same icon:
- ⚠️ Development flavor → generic `ic_launcher.png`
- ⚠️ Staging flavor → generic `ic_launcher.png`
- ⚠️ Production flavor → generic `ic_launcher.png`

**Location:** `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/`

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### Option 1: Update with Current Logos

If your current logos are good to use:

```bash
# This will regenerate ALL icons (iOS + Android) from your existing logos
./scripts/update_all_icons.sh
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Regenerates iOS icons from your current logos
- ✅ **NEW:** Creates flavor-specific Android icons
- ✅ Each flavor gets its own distinct icon on Android

### Option 2: Replace Logos First, Then Update

If you want NEW logos:

1. **Create or export new logo designs** (1024×1024 minimum, 2048×2048 recommended)
   
2. **Replace the files:**
   ```bash
   # Replace with your new designs
   assets/logo/trackflow_dev.png      (or .jpg)
   assets/logo/trackflow_staging.png  (or .jpg)
   assets/logo/trackflow_prod.png     (or .jpg)
   ```

3. **Run the generator:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/update_all_icons.sh
   ```

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Step 1: Review Your Current Logos

Open the files in `assets/logo/` and check:
- [ ] Do they represent your brand well?
- [ ] Are dev/staging visually distinct from production?
- [ ] Do they look good at small sizes?
- [ ] Are there any improvements needed?

### Step 2: Decide on Update Strategy

**Use current logos?** → Go to Step 3
**Create new logos?** → Design new ones, replace files, go to Step 3

### Step 3: Generate All Icons

```bash
# One command does everything
./scripts/update_all_icons.sh
```

This creates:
- **iOS:** 45 icons (15 per flavor × 3 flavors)
- **Android:** 20 icons (5 densities × 3 flavors + 5 main fallback)

**Time:** ~30 seconds

### Step 4: Clean and Test

```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Test each flavor
flutter run --flavor development
flutter run --flavor staging  
flutter run --flavor production
```

### Step 5: Verify on Device

1. Install each flavor on a real device
2. Check home screen icon
3. Check app switcher
4. Check settings/app list

## 🎨 Design Recommendations

### For Development Flavor
Add visual indicator that this is DEV:
- Add "DEV" text badge
- Use distinct color (e.g., orange/yellow overlay)
- Add border or different background

### For Staging Flavor
Distinguish from both dev and production:
- Add "STAGE" or "STG" text badge
- Use different color (e.g., blue/purple overlay)
- Different badge position than dev

### For Production Flavor
Clean, polished, final version:
- No badges or overlays
- Professional appearance
- Matches your brand identity
