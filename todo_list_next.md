### Step 1: Fix Core Service (30 minutes)
```dart
// Fix AudioPlaybackServiceImpl interface alignment
@override
Future<void> play(AudioSource source) async {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Step 2: Fix PlaybackSession (15 minutes)
```dart
// Add missing factory constructor
factory PlaybackSession.withTrack(AudioTrackMetadata track) {
  return PlaybackSession(
    currentTrack: track,
    queue: AudioQueue.withTrack(track),
    state: PlaybackState.ready,
