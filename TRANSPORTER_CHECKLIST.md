## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with Signing Error
**Fix:**
1. Open Xcode: `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
2. Select "Runner" project
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
4. Ensure "Staging" configuration has:
   - Team selected
   - Provisioning profile assigned
5. Clean and rebuild

### "Application failed to verify"
**Fix:**
- Ensure certificates are valid in Apple Developer portal
- Re-download provisioning profiles
- Clean build folder: `flutter clean`

### Upload Fails in Transporter
**Fix:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Apple Developer account has upload permissions
- Try re-uploading (sometimes temporary server issues)
- Check App Store Connect for any app-specific issues

### Build Number Already Used
**Fix:**
- The script auto-generates unique build numbers using timestamp
- If manually building, increment build number
- Build numbers must be unique for each upload

### Wrong Icon Appears
**Fix:**
- Verify icon generation ran successfully
- Check `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon-Staging.appiconset/`
- Re-run: `./scripts/generate_ios_icons_sips.sh`
- Clean and rebuild
