## 🚀 Quick Commands

### Test Your Workflows

```bash
# CI Pipeline
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref your-branch

# Debug Build
gh workflow run build-debug.yml --ref develop -f flavor=development

# Monitor Progress
gh run list --limit 5
gh run watch [RUN_ID]
```

### Create Releases

```bash
# Production Release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Beta Release
gh workflow run build-release.yml -f version=0.1.0-beta
```

## 📱 Workflow Architecture

```
Code Push → CI (Quality Gates) → Debug Build → Firebase Distribution
     ↓                                ↓
Tag Push → Release Build → Store Upload → GitHub Release
```

### 4 Main Workflows:

1. **🧪 CI**: Quality gates (tests, analysis, security)
2. **🔨 Debug**: Development builds with Firebase distribution
3. **🚀 Release**: Production builds for app stores
4. **🔥 Firebase**: Beta distribution to testers

---

## 🏪 Store Distribution Ready

Your workflows are **production-ready** for:

- ✅ **Google Play Store**: AAB files with automatic upload
- ✅ **Apple App Store**: IPA files with TestFlight upload
- ✅ **Firebase App Distribution**: Beta testing distribution
- ✅ **GitHub Releases**: Automatic release creation

**Missing**: Store signing certificates and API keys (see setup guides)
