# TrackFlow SOLID Refactor Execution Checklist

## Phase 0: Preparation
- [x] Complete backup of codebase
- [x] Execute full test suite and save baseline (49 passed, 32 failed - baseline established)
- [x] Create main refactor branch: `refactor/solid-architecture`

## Phase 1: Entities Refactor
- [x] Remove duplicate identifiers (e.g., AudioTrackId)
- [x] Migrate all identifiers to ValueObject or Entity as appropriate
- [x] Refactor entities to extend Entity<T>
- [x] Remove redundant equality in UniqueId and ValueObject
- [x] Update imports and references throughout codebase
- [x] ~~Execute and fix domain and entity tests~~ (SKIPPED - Tests after complete refactor)

## Phase 2: Data Sources Refactor
- [ ] Divide data sources with multiple responsibilities (SRP, ISP)
- [ ] Create new specialized interfaces and migrate implementations
- [ ] Refactor duplicate methods and consolidate logic in repositories
- [ ] Standardize all methods to `Either<Failure, T>`
- [ ] Migrate tests and update dependency injection
- [ ] Validate integration with refactored entities
- [ ] ~~Execute data sources test suite~~ (SKIPPED - Tests after complete refactor)

## Phase 3: Repositories Refactor
- [ ] Divide repositories with multiple responsibilities into specialized interfaces
- [ ] Implement generic base repositories where applicable
- [ ] Apply CQRS in features that require it (e.g., AudioTrack)
- [ ] Implement Specification Pattern for complex queries
- [ ] Update dependencies and DI
- [ ] Migrate and create integration tests and mocks
- [ ] Validate integration with data sources and refactored entities
- [ ] ~~Execute complete test suite~~ (SKIPPED - Tests after complete refactor)

## Phase 4: Validation and Cleanup
- [ ] ~~Execute complete test suite~~ (SKIPPED - Tests after complete refactor)
- [ ] ~~Validate code coverage~~ (SKIPPED - Tests after complete refactor)
- [ ] Perform performance benchmarks
- [ ] Update technical documentation
- [ ] Architectural code review

## General Guidelines
- All documentation and code comments must be written in English
- Make small, atomic commits for each refactored sub-feature
- Maintain backup branches for each phase
- Use feature flags if progressive migration is needed
- **IMPORTANT: NO TESTING UNTIL REFACTOR IS COMPLETE** - Tests will be handled after the entire lib/ directory is refactored
- Document each relevant change in README or project wiki
