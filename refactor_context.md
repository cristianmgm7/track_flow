# TrackFlow SOLID Refactor - Current Context

## Current Status
**Phase:** Phase 3 - Repository Refactor  
**Step:** Ready to begin repository SOLID improvements  
**Progress:** Phase 2 Complete (100%)

## Active Branch
- Working on: `refactor/solid-architecture`
- Base branch: `main`

## Phase 2 Completion Summary
✅ AuthLocalDataSource SRP violation fixed (split into specialized data sources)  
✅ Return types standardized to Either<Failure, T> for all core data sources  
✅ AudioTrack, AudioComment, Projects, Playlist data sources standardized  
✅ Comprehensive error handling added to all data sources  
✅ Data source duplicate methods identified and documented  
✅ MagicLink feature deferred (not active yet)  

## Current Objectives
1. Divide repositories with multiple responsibilities into specialized interfaces
2. Implement generic base repositories where applicable
3. Apply CQRS patterns where needed
4. Implement Specification Pattern for complex queries

## Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Analyze repositories for SOLID violations
2. Apply SRP and ISP to repository interfaces
3. Implement repository base classes
4. Update dependency injection

## Notes
- All documentation and code must be written in English
- Following SOLID principles and DDD patterns
- **NO TESTING DURING REFACTOR** - Tests will be handled after complete lib/ refactor
- Using atomic commits for each sub-feature

## Timeline
- **Start Date:** 2025-07-02
- **Estimated Duration:** 6 weeks
- **Current Week:** 1

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** Low (preparation phase)
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive backup and baseline testing before major changes
