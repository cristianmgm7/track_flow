# TrackFlow SOLID Refactor - Current Context

## Current Status
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Data Sources Refactor  
**Step:** Beginning data sources segregation and standardization  
**Progress:** Phase 1 Complete (100%)

## Active Branch
- Working on: `refactor/solid-architecture`
- Base branch: `main`

## Phase 1 Completion Summary
✅ AudioTrackId duplication resolved  
✅ All entities migrated to Entity<T>/AggregateRoot<T> inheritance  
✅ UniqueId redundant equality removed  
✅ All imports and references updated  
✅ Entity constructors standardized  

## Current Objectives
1. Divide data sources with multiple responsibilities (SRP, ISP)
2. Create new specialized interfaces and migrate implementations
3. Refactor duplicate methods and consolidate logic in repositories
4. Standardize all methods to `Either<Failure, T>`

## Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Analyze current data sources for SRP violations
2. Segregate interfaces per responsibility
3. Eliminate duplicate methods
4. Standardize return types

## Notes
- All documentation and code must be written in English
- Following SOLID principles and DDD patterns
- **NO TESTING DURING REFACTOR** - Tests will be handled after complete lib/ refactor
- Using atomic commits for each sub-feature

## Timeline
- **Start Date:** 2025-07-02
- **Estimated Duration:** 6 weeks
- **Current Week:** 1

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** Low (preparation phase)
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive backup and baseline testing before major changes
